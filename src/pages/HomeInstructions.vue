      Instructions

      <p>
        If you've made it this far you've already completed the first step by installing the project dependencies and starting your Vue development server... good job!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Please read all instructions carefully before you begin to work on the exercises.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This challenge consists of 3 exercises. The goal is to get a sense for how you solve problems and implement your code - these questions are not designed to trick you.
      </p>

      <p>
        No additional packages or libraries are required to complete this challenge but you may add any that you wish. Please do not modify this instructions component (found at <p-code inline>
          /src/pages/HomeInstructions.vue
        </p-code>) or any of the instruction text for the exercise (these will be clearly denoted in the code) until your submission has been graded. Any other code (including router, store, styling, and components) are free for you to modify at your discretion.
      </p>

        <em>Tip:</em> The <p-code inline>
          p-
        </p-code> prefixed components in this application come from the <p-link href="https://prefect-design.netlify.app">
          Prefect Design
        </p-link> library. You're free to use these components in your solution if you wish but you're not required to do so.

        Making the repo public
      </p-heading>

      <p>
        <strong>The work you do on this project is your own</strong>. As such, you can make it publicly available at your discretion (on your GitHub, as part of a portfolio etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you plan to make this repository public, <strong>please do not do so until after your submission has been graded</strong> (we'll let you know when that is!). In addition, please remove or replace Prefect in the <p-code inline>
          &lt;title&gt;
        </p-code> block of the root html file (found in  <p-code inline>

        </p-code>) and any associated logos.
